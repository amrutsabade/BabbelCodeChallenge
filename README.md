# BabbelCodeChallenge

#I Have amlost invested 7 hours for this Code Challenge

Regarding distribution i spent around 1-1.5 hour understanding and Conceptualizing the solution for e.g how to achive certain parts , Code structure etc then around 1 hour for parsing and making data avaliable for the apparound 2 hours for creating main view model and business logic around the game around 1 hour for creating UI and and integrating with the business logic around 1 hour for handling edge cases etc ,refactoring and around 30 min for writing Unit Tests

I Went ahead with MVVM Archicture for the app and handling all the business logic in ViewModel

Due to resctriction I have not written UI Tests which also UI I have kept it simple 

If I had more time I would focus on adding new more tests, making code more sclable and also using combine(currently learning)
